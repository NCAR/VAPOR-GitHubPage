DART has been reformulated to better support the ensemble data assimilation needs of researchers who are interested in native netCDF support, less filesystem I/O, better computational performance, good scaling for large processor counts, and support for the memory requirements of very large models. Manhattan has support for many of our larger models (**WRF, POP, CAM, CICE, CLM, ROMS, MPAS_ATM,** ...) with many more being added as time permits. The hallmarks of DART; tutorials, examples, extensive documentation, introductory materials, and performance diagnostics are maintained in an easier-to-grasp organization:

1. assimilation_code ( programs and support modules )
2. build_templates ( hardware/compiler options )
3. diagnostics
4. documentation
5. developer_tests
6. models
7. observations ( observation converters and forward operators )
